The Group Travel Recommender System (GRecTr) is an intelligent web-based application designed to streamline and personalize travel planning for groups with diverse preferences. It uses a hybrid recommendation engine that combines collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and constraint satisfaction techniques to deliver highly accurate travel suggestions, achieving a recommendation accuracy of 89.7%. Developed with a Flask-SQLAlchemy backend and a responsive React-Bootstrap frontend, the system captures and analyzes user profiles, group dynamics, and travel history. It incorporates immersive 360Â° virtual reality previews to enhance destination exploration and features real-time itinerary management to adapt to travel disruptions such as delays or closures. To ensure global accessibility, the system includes multilingual support powered by natural language processing. By leveraging techniques like cosine similarity, alternating least squares, and XGBoost-based preference prediction, GRecTr provides scalable, personalized, and group-aligned travel recommendations. Its modular, containerized architecture makes it suitable for varied scenarios ranging from family vacations to corporate retreats, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction and decision-making in group travel planning.
